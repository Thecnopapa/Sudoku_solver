# Sudoku Solver

Script that solves sudokus of any difficulty.
> If the sudoku is hard it will forcefuly find the solution, which can be slow

## Instructions
- run `solver_ultimate.py` and enter the sudoku using `0` for the missing values

> Requieres `numpy` and `itertools`

> Note that the script is old and I didn't really know much python then. It is horribly not optimised.
